🌱 Soil Analysis & Crop Recommendation using ANN
The project is about forecasting the best-suited crop from soil and environmental factors by employing an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. It's a data science solution to help farmers and agronomists take appropriate decisions for enhancing productivity and sustainable agriculture.

📌 Problem Statement

Predict the best crop to plant, given a set of "climatic and soil features". The intention is to aid in optimizing yield and minimizing the risk of bad harvest from crop-soil incompatibility.

📚 Dataset Overview

The dataset is sourced from **Kaggle** and contains the following key features:

- `N`, `P`, `K` - Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium content in soil
- `temperature` - Ambient temperature in °C
- `humidity` - Relative humidity %
- `ph` - pH value of the soil
- `rainfall` - Rainfall in mm
- `label` - Target variable (Recommended Crop)

🧠 Model Overview

- Model Type: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Framework: TensorFlow / Keras
- Architecture: 
  - Input Layer: 7 features
  - Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
  - Output Layer: Softmax for multiclass classification
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Optimizer: Adam
- Metrics: Accuracy

🛠️ Steps Performed

1. Data Preprocessing
   - Data cleaning and exploration
   - Feature scaling
   - Encoding target labels

2. Model Building
   - Defined a Sequential ANN architecture
   - Compiled and trained on processed data
   - Evaluated accuracy and loss

3. Visualization
   - Training vs Validation loss/accuracy plots

4. Prediction
   - Crop recommendation based on user input or test data

📊 Results

- Accuracy Achieved: ~97–99% (based on notebook results)
- Model performs well in recommending appropriate crops for varying environmental conditions.

💡 Use Cases

- Precision Agriculture
- Smart Farming Applications
- AgriTech SaaS Platforms
- Government & NGO Agricultural Advisory Services

🚀 Future Enhancements

- Integrate real-time weather and soil data
- Convert model into a web/mobile app using Flask or Streamlit
- Add pest/disease prediction layer for full agricultural recommendation system
